    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.

            salt, and pepper. Cook over low heat until sauce  is hot, about 15 minutes.

            Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. 
            Cook mafalda noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
        </li>

        <li>
            Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir until completely coated. 
            Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.
        </li>

        <li>
            Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
        </li>
